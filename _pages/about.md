I am an undergraduate student majoring Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University. I am an undergraduate research intern at [SCALE Lab](http://scale.snu.ac.kr/), Seoul National University, led by Prof. Jungho Ahn. I was also advised by Prof. [Daejin Park](https://ai-soc.github.io/l_professor.html). My research interests include machine learning for system and memory management.
