Hi, I am an undergraduate student majoring Computer Science and Engineering at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html). I am an undergraduate research intern at [Scale Lab](http://scale.snu.ac.kr/), Seoul National University, led by Prof. Jungho Ahn. I was also Prof. Daejin Park at Kyungpook National University. My research interests include machine learning for system and memory management.
